# HexingBootsectors
This repo is basically just a collection of bootsectors as recently ive been interested in fitting code in small locations.
These are made with a mix of reading a opcode table and writing in HxD such as for typing.img or using an assembler with the
case of colorful.img.
I also want to make tools to help me write these at a higher level and put them here.
